🚀 SQL Data Analysis Project: PizzaHut Sales Insights 🍕

I recently worked on a comprehensive SQL project using a fictional PizzaHut dataset containing four interconnected tables. This hands-on project helped me dive deep into real-world business insights using SQL – from basic data exploration to advanced analytical queries.

📊 Key Highlights:

Total orders and revenue generated from pizza sales 🍕💰

Top 5 most ordered pizza types and most preferred pizza size

Revenue distribution by pizza category

Hourly order trends and daily pizza demand 📈

Cumulative sales performance over time

Category-wise top-performing pizzas by revenue

🔍 I applied SQL joins, aggregations, window functions, subqueries, and more to extract actionable insights.

📌 This project sharpened my SQL skills in data analysis and business intelligence. Looking forward to exploring more datasets and solving real-world problems with data!
